<p align="center">Framework for coming up with ideas for your capstone project as well as other projects in the future.

# Coding Temple Capstone Project
Coding Temple prides itself on creating ready professionals to enter the software engineering field and solve problems from day one. The only way to gain that type of control is through creating a project. We are looking for students to incorporate all of the knowledge gained through-out the course of the Full Stack/Front-End course. This includes but should not be limited to, (FullStack)(use the framework below) Creating and hosting an API service, Create a database to support API service, Use API service inside of a frontend built with a framework from the course. (Front-End)Create a Design for your application, implement the design, the project should engest a third-party API of your choosing. Once the project is completed, tested and ready to launch it should then be hosted. You may use Glitch to accomplish this.


# About the framework

Sometimes it can be difficult to come up with a capstone project idea that excites you and makes you want to work on it. This framework is designed to help you create a capstone project that is personal to you, that you have a very clear interest in. Feel free to add to your capstone project in the future, but we must warn you...BEWARE OF SCOPE CREEP! Start with the minimal viable product (MVP) version of the project first - bringing that to completion first. 


 


# Getting Started

## 1. Choose Topic
Pick something you are interested in. This will keep you motivated during the hard times (and there will be hard times). 

| Topic |
|:---:|
| photography |
| reading |
| sport (football, tennis, training) |
| video games |
| movies |
| cars |
| travel |
| collecting things |
| fishing |
| fashion |
| any hobby from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hobbies)|

## 2. Choose Service
This will give your project meaning, something that you and perhaps others may use in real life

|Examples of services|
|:---:|
| catalogs and data trackers/logs |
| planners and reminders <br /> (but NOT a todo) |
| project management tools |
| calculators and converters |
| social interaction |
| motivational services |
| accessibility services |


## 3. Choose Technology
This will give meaning to your hard work, while using what you've been learning. You will be able to truly measure your progress in multiple areas and become stronger in areas you may have felt unsure of. Honestly, some areas might make more sense than others and that's ok. Take note of those areas and add features that force you to use those skills in the future. For example, if you would like to get a better understanding of the front-end (CSS for a more direct example) then make sure to challenge your current design in the future. 


|Technology Concepts| Things To Remember/Practice |
|:---:| :---:|
| Css and HTML | Use skills discussed from earlier modules - If more backend, start minimal and add later |
| JavaScript | Large part of learning any Front-End Framework |
| Frontend and/or Backend language | oop concepts, design patterns, s.o.l.i.d.,  automated testing... |
| Database and storage | CRUD, relations, normalization, logging in files, files and images manipulation...|
| API integration | google maps, eBay, Wikipedia, google books, amazon, your own service...|
| data manipulation | calculation, conversion |
| security | best practices, protection, common problems |
| authorization and authentication | local or external (auth0, google, facebook, custom...)
|package management|npm, yarn, composer|
|mobile applications|native, flutter, ionic|

## 4. Now make it
Combine some or several of the things above, and try to come up with something that will be useful, and also something where you will dive deeper into a subject you want to know on a deeper level.

Some sample projects:

|Project|Tool suggestions|
|:---:| :---:|
| Clothes recommendation system based on interest, which links to amazon search| fashion + catalogs + API integration |
|Photography golden hour calculator with google maps | Photography + calculators + API integration|
|DVD/CD collection tool|movies + catalogs + database (+imdb API?)|
|hotel reviews from multiple websites |travel + social interaction + data manipulation|

One good tip: Imagine meeting your favourite developer/investor/mentor, and he asks you:
- [ ] What are you working on (and why)?
- [ ] What technologies are you using (and why)?
- [ ] What is your goal (and why)?
- [ ] What have you learned (and why)?
- [ ] What you liked most (and why)?
- [ ] What is the most difficult thing (and why)?

If you start with your project, and after a month you can answer these questions from above, you are ready for an interview with a company that uses that technology.
